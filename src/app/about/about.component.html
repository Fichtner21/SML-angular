      <strong>Old friends</strong> reunited for the first lockdown in March 2020. Since then, we play almost every day, and from November 2020 we created the <strong>MoH:SH Mix League</strong>. During the year we played almost <strong>800 wars</strong>, and almost <strong>80</strong> people played in our league, most of them remembering the times of playing clanbase.
